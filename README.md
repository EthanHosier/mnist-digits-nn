# mnist-digits-nn
Neural network written from scratch in java with no external libraries. Trained on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. Created as a learning exercise during the Summer of 2021.

Extract from Resume:
- Developed a deep multilayer perceptron neural network in Java for handwritten digit recognition, without any machine learning or maths libraries. Implemented backpropagation from scratch
- Achieved a 92.58% accuracy on identifying unseen hand-drawn digits between 0 and 9 after training on the MNIST dataset
- Developed a GUI using Swing for drawing digits and used the network to identify them accurately
- Explored the concepts of underfitting and overfitting by altering neuron layer structures, batch sizes and epoch sizes during training
- Successfully implemented stochastic gradient descent from scratch
